# Parkar

Idea: given a heatmap representing traffic in a parking lot, the program will find up to 3 available parking spots and show directions to them in real-time updating.

Language: C/C++
Tools: SDL library
Algorithm: Dijkstra

DEMO: Please look for the Parkar.mp4 file in the repository. It is a simulation of what's going on in a parking lot and how the program would continuously adjust and find new parking spots.

Presentation: Please look for parkar.ppt file in the repository

Difference from google map: While google map only shows direction from point A to point B, this program can handle multiple destinations as the same time, giving users more choices.

Further development idea: This program does not necessarily stops at parking issues. Because the program can find multiple destinations based on a provided starting point. It can applies to many more things such as flood navigation, large-scale urban area navigation (Look more in the presentation file).
